                    <h2>Skills and Competencies</h2>

                    <h4>Automotive skills</h4>
                    <p>Being raised in the automotive industry I have a superior understanding of mechanical and
                        automotive electrical work. I can fully wire a complete engine management on a car.</p>

                    <h4>Marine skills</h4>
                    <p>I successfully obtained my Category B skippers . This means that I can pilot/captain a motorized
                        vessel under 31ft through the surf zone and up to 40 nautical miles off shore. Within the
                        training
                        I attained First-aid training. This includes training in Stroke scenarios, Fatal bleeding
                        wounds,
                        Emergency transmission, Safety briefings and General precautions.</p>

                    <h4>Boating skills</h4>
                    <p>I have been a deckhand on large vessels and work in a family owned vessel storage company. With
                        this I gained experience in fiberglass work, outboard engines (two and four-stroke, inboard
                        engines are
                        adapted from the
                        automotive industry), general rigging and maintenance on boats.</p>

                    <h4>Fishing skills</h4>
                    <p>I grew up in the northern coast of South Africa. This means that Fishing was a main occurrence in
                        my family.
                        With the 12 years of having the privilege of owning a vessel, I have been fortunate enough to
                        have some of
                        the worlds best anglers teaching me from scratch. I have a vast experience in game fishing, in
                        which I have
                        attended many International, National, Provincial and Inter-club events. I have achieved
                        national and
                        provincial
                        colors in game fishing and home colors for inter-club fishing events.</p>

                    <h4>People skills</h4>
                    <p>With the automotive business and vessel storage company comes one glitch in the matrix that
                        everyone is prone
                        to : People.
                        I work with walk-in and mobile clients on a daily basis. I am fully able
                        to handle
                        clients in a professional matter even if they are being difficult or rude.
                        I can easily merge with team members and become a part of the working gears that run a business
                        from inside.
